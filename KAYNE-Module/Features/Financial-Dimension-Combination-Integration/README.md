# Financial Dimension Combination Integration

**Purpose:** To ensure accurate and consistent financial reporting and analysis by providing a robust mechanism for importing, exporting, and validating combinations of financial dimensions, especially when integrating with external systems or during data migration.

## Overview

This feature facilitates the integration and management of valid financial dimension combinations within Dynamics 365 Finance & Operations, primarily through data entities.

- **Object Count:** 1
- **Cohesion Score:** 0.00

## Entry Points

- Data Management workspace (for data import/export projects using the DimensionCombinationEntity)
- OData services consuming the DimensionCombinationEntity
- Custom integrations or APIs built on top of the DimensionCombinationEntity

## Business Logic

The DimensionCombinationEntity serves as the primary interface for managing valid financial dimension combinations. The DimensionIntegration extension likely enhances or customizes the standard integration logic for this entity. This involves processes such as validation, ensuring that imported or created dimension combinations adhere to the defined accounting structures and rules (e.g., specific departments can only be combined with certain cost centers). It also facilitates data mapping from external systems and enables the synchronization of dimension combinations, including creation, update, and deletion. The feature provides mechanisms for error handling to identify and report invalid dimension combinations during integration, preventing data corruption. The overall goal is to maintain the integrity of financial dimension data, which is crucial for accurate general ledger postings and comprehensive financial reporting.
