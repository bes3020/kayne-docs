## Business Logic

The LedgerTransAccountAKA_Extension class likely extends the core logic responsible for determining and validating ledger accounts during the posting of financial transactions. Specifically, it would contain logic to identify transactions that require intercompany account resolution. When an intercompany scenario is detected, the class would consult predefined 'Also Known As' (AKA) account mappings to substitute the original account with the correct corresponding account for the target legal entity. This ensures that a transaction originating in one company, but impacting another, is recorded using the appropriate chart of accounts and financial dimensions in both entities. This automated mapping is crucial for maintaining data integrity, streamlining intercompany reconciliation, and facilitating accurate consolidated financial reporting.
