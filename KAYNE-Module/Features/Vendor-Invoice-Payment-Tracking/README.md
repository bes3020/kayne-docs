## Business Logic

The core business logic encapsulated by the AKAVendTransInvoicePaymentQuery involves joining and filtering vendor transaction data. It typically selects records from the VendTrans table, distinguishing between invoice and payment types. The query is designed to link payments to the specific invoices they settle, likely through tables like VendSettlement, to provide a comprehensive view of the payment lifecycle for each vendor invoice. This allows for detailed analysis of paid, partially paid, and outstanding invoices, potentially including details like payment dates, amounts, and settlement references. The query serves as a foundational data source for various analytical and reporting needs within accounts payable.
