- **Object Count:** 1
- **Cohesion Score:** 0.00

## Entry Points

- Label files do not have direct user entry points. They are consumed indirectly by forms, reports, and messages within the 'AKA' module or any other application object that references labels from the AKA_en-US file.

## Business Logic

An AxLabelFile, such as 'AKA_en-US', does not contain executable business logic. Its sole purpose is to store key-value pairs where keys are label IDs and values are the corresponding localized strings for the English (United States) language. These labels are referenced at runtime by various application components (forms, reports, classes, menu items) to display user-friendly text, captions, messages, and tooltips. The 'AKA_en-US' file specifically supports the localization requirements for the 'AKA' module, ensuring that all user-facing text is presented consistently in the specified language. The actual business logic that utilizes these labels resides in the consuming application objects.
