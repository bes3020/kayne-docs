- **Object Count:** 1
- **Cohesion Score:** 0.00

## Entry Points

- General journal form (LedgerJournalTable)
- Project journal forms (e.g., ProjJournalTable, if applicable for ledger integration)
- Any process that creates or modifies LedgerJournalTrans records with a project context

## Business Logic

The LedgerJournalTrans_Project_FSAKA_Extension class likely contains methods that hook into the lifecycle of LedgerJournalTrans records when they are associated with projects. This extension class would implement specific 'FSAKA' related business logic, which could include custom validation rules for project journal lines, defaulting of specific fields or financial dimensions, performing specialized calculations (e.g., for taxes or cost allocations), or enriching data on the journal line before posting. The primary goal is to modify or enhance the standard project journal line processing to meet unique 'FSAKA' requirements.
