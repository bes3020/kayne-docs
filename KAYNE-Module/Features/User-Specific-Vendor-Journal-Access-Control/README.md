# User-Specific Vendor Journal Access Control

**Purpose:** The primary business purpose is to enhance data security, improve accountability, and streamline financial operations by preventing unauthorized access and modifications to vendor journals. It ensures that users interact solely with the journals for which they are explicitly authorized, thereby reducing errors and maintaining data integrity.

## Overview

This feature implements a security layer to restrict user access to vendor journals, ensuring that individuals can only view and manage journals relevant to their assigned responsibilities or those they have created.

- **Object Count:** 1
- **Cohesion Score:** 0.00

## Entry Points

- Forms: Standard vendor journal entry forms (e.g., VendJournalTable, LedgerJournalTable) where the underlying data is filtered based on user permissions.
- Data Entities: Custom data entities (e.g., AKAVendJournalByUserEntity) designed for integration or reporting, which are secured by this privilege to expose only user-specific journal data.
- Menu Items: Menu items that navigate to these forms or enable operations on the secured data entities.

## Business Logic

The core business logic of this feature centers on enforcing granular access control for vendor journals. The AKAVendJournalByUserEntityView security privilege grants permissions to an underlying data entity or view that dynamically filters vendor journal records. This filtering mechanism typically uses criteria such as the journal's 'CreatedBy' user, an assigned 'ResponsibleWorker', or other user-specific attributes. When a user attempts to access vendor journals through forms or data entities, this privilege ensures that only the records matching their authorized scope are displayed and modifiable. This segregation of duties prevents users from inadvertently or maliciously accessing journals outside their purview, thereby safeguarding financial data, improving auditability, and optimizing workflows by presenting users with a focused set of relevant journals.
