- **Cohesion Score:** 0.00

## Entry Points

- Data management workspace (for entity import/export)

## Business Logic

The core business logic revolves around the creation, modification, and deletion of 'Main Account Mask' records. These masks likely define patterns, criteria, or rules for General Ledger main account numbers. The 'AKAMainAccountsMaskEntityMaintain' security privilege grants users the necessary permissions to perform these maintenance operations, typically through a data entity exposed via the Data Management framework or a dedicated configuration form. The maintained masks can then be utilized by other system components for purposes such as data validation during imports, filtering, or specific reporting requirements related to GL accounts.
