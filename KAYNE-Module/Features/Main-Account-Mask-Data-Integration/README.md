## Business Logic

The core of this feature is the `AKAMainAccountsMaskEntityView` data entity, which consolidates and exposes relevant data pertaining to main accounts and their defined 'masks' or structural rules. This entity abstracts the underlying General Ledger tables to provide a simplified, consumable view. The `AKAMainAccountsMaskEntityView (AxSecurityPrivilege)` ensures that access to this sensitive financial configuration data is restricted to authorized users and integration services. The entity's logic would involve querying and joining tables related to main accounts and their dimension attributes or account structures to present the 'mask' information, which could include segment formats, validation rules, or specific structural definitions applied to main accounts. This data is primarily intended for read-only integration scenarios, allowing for consistent consumption of main account setup details.
