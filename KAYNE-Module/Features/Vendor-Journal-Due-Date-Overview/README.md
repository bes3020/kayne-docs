## Business Logic

The core business logic involves the creation and processing of ledger journal entries related to vendors, such as vendor invoices or payment journals. During this process, payment terms are applied to calculate and assign a due date to each vendor transaction. The `AKALedgerJournalVendDueDateSingleView` then consolidates relevant data from these journal lines, potentially joining with vendor and ledger tables, to present a focused perspective on the vendor, journal details, and crucially, the payment due date. This view simplifies data retrieval for applications that need to display or report on vendor payment obligations, helping users identify payments that are due soon or are already overdue, without needing to navigate complex underlying table structures.
