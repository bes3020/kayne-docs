- **Cohesion Score:** 0.00

## Entry Points

- Menu items and forms related to project cost transactions, such as 'Project transactions', 'Project costs', 'Project journals', or specific forms for recording expenses or item consumption against projects. The privilege itself is not an entry point but controls access to these.

## Business Logic

The core business logic revolves around the lifecycle of project costs. This includes the ability to: 1. Record Costs: Capture various types of costs (e.g., item consumption, hours worked, expenses, fees) directly against specific projects and project activities. 2. Categorize and Allocate: Assign costs to appropriate cost categories and potentially allocate them across different project dimensions. 3. Posting: Process and post project cost transactions, which may result in updates to the general ledger, project sub-ledger, and project profitability reports. 4. Inquiry and Reporting: Provide functionality to view detailed project cost transactions, generate cost analysis reports, and track project budget versus actuals. 5. Security Enforcement: The AKAProjTransCost privilege ensures that all these actions are performed by users with the necessary authorization, preventing unauthorized access or manipulation of critical project financial data.
