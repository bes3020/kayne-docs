## Business Logic

The LedgerJournalMultiEntityAKA_Extension class likely contains business logic that intercepts or augments standard ledger journal operations when dealing with transactions that span multiple legal entities. This could involve implementing specific validation rules for cross-entity journal lines, automating the generation of offsetting intercompany entries, managing financial dimensions or accounts unique to multi-entity postings, or modifying the user interface to improve the data entry experience for such journals. The primary goal is to ensure data integrity, compliance, and accurate financial reporting across all involved legal entities when a single journal entry affects more than one company.
