- Project Cost Journal form (ProjCostJournal)

## Business Logic

The `ProjPostCostJournalAKA_Extension` class is an extension to the standard project cost journal posting process. It would typically contain event handlers or method extensions that intercept the default posting logic. This could involve implementing additional pre-validation checks before a journal is allowed to post, modifying cost allocation rules, enriching journal lines with custom data, or triggering post-posting actions such as updates to related project records or integration with external systems. The 'AKA' in the name suggests it might address a specific type of cost, a particular project requirement, or a unique business scenario that necessitated this custom extension to the standard posting routine.
