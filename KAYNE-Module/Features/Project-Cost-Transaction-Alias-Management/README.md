## Business Logic

The ProjCostTransAKA_Extension class likely contains methods that intercept or enhance the creation, update, and retrieval of ProjCostTrans records. Its core logic would involve managing and applying alternative identifiers (aliases) to project cost transactions. This could include validating and storing alias information alongside standard cost transaction data, providing methods to retrieve cost transactions based on their aliases, and integrating alias data into project reports or inquiries. It may also implement custom logic for how these aliases affect cost calculations or allocations, ensuring that project costs can be analyzed and reported under different classification schemes.
