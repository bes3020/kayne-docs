## Business Logic

The AKAFinancialReportsCOMPPolicy is an X++ security policy designed to enforce data access restrictions on financial reports. It likely uses a query to filter records from financial reporting-related tables (e.g., GeneralJournalAccountEntry, MainAccount, DimensionAttributeValueCombination) based on specific criteria such as the user's assigned legal entities, departments, or other organizational hierarchies. This ensures that when a user generates or views a financial report, they only see data for which they have explicit permission, thereby maintaining data segregation and adhering to internal or external compliance requirements. The policy is applied automatically whenever a user attempts to access data covered by its scope.
