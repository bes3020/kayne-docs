## Business Logic

The core business logic of this feature revolves around defining alphanumeric patterns (masks) that main account numbers must conform to. These masks specify the structure, length, and character types allowed for main accounts, ensuring consistency and preventing data entry errors. When main accounts are created or modified, the system validates the input against these active masks. This ensures that all main accounts adhere to predefined organizational standards, which is crucial for accurate financial reporting, analysis, and integration with other modules. The `AKAMainAccountMaskView` privilege specifically governs the ability to view these configured main account masks and their associated validation rules, without allowing modification.
