## Business Logic

The `LedgerJournalMultiEntityStaging` table acts as an intermediary for ledger journal data that needs to be processed across multiple legal entities. The core business logic involves the ingestion of journal data into this staging table, often via the Data Management framework or integration services. Once staged, the data undergoes validation to ensure accuracy, compliance with multi-entity posting rules, and proper legal entity identification. Following successful validation, the system transforms and transfers these validated entries into the actual `LedgerJournalTable` and `LedgerJournalTrans` tables within the respective legal entities. This process typically includes handling currency conversions, intercompany balancing, and ensuring the correct posting of transactions in each designated company. The `AxTableExtension` would likely introduce additional fields or modify existing behavior to support specific business requirements within this staging and processing workflow.
