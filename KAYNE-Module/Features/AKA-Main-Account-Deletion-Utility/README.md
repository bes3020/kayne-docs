- **Object Count:** 1
- **Cohesion Score:** 1.00

## Entry Points

- AKADeleteMainAccounts (AxClass - programmatic entry point)
- Potentially invoked via a custom menu item (e.g., 'Delete Main Accounts') or a form action.

## Business Logic

The AKADeleteMainAccounts class encapsulates the core business logic for the deletion of main accounts. This process is critical and involves robust validation to prevent data corruption. The class would typically perform checks to ensure that a main account is not associated with any posted financial transactions, active account structures, budget entries, or other critical configurations across the system. If a main account passes all these stringent validation criteria, the class proceeds with its removal from the General Ledger. The dependency on a table, also named AKADeleteMainAccounts, suggests it might be used for staging accounts for deletion, logging the deletion process and its outcomes (success or failure reasons), or storing configuration related to the deletion utility. The class likely provides methods to initiate the deletion, perform individual validation steps, and manage the underlying database operations securely.
