- **Object Count:** 4
- **Cohesion Score:** 1.00

## Entry Points

- Likely consumed by a custom form (e.g., 'AKA Vendor Invoice Inquiry') or a report that utilizes AKAVendInvoiceQuery.

## Business Logic

The core business logic centers on aggregating and presenting a holistic view of vendor invoices. The AKAVendInvoiceQuery serves as the central mechanism, joining data from three specialized views: AKAVendInvoiceInfoView (providing general invoice header and line details), AKAVendInvoiceOpenJournalView (displaying invoices that are still in a pending or unposted state within journals), and AKAVendInvoicePostedJournalView (showing invoices that have been finalized and posted to the ledger). This structure allows for a complete lifecycle view of a vendor invoice, enabling users to quickly ascertain an invoice's current status and access all relevant details, whether it's still being processed or has already been accounted for.
