- **Object Count:** 1
- **Cohesion Score:** 0.00

## Entry Points

- OData endpoint (e.g., /data/AKAVendJournalByUsers)
- Data Management Framework (DMF) import/export projects
- Power Apps
- Power BI

## Business Logic

The core business logic of this feature is encapsulated within the `AKAVendJournalByUserEntity` AxDataEntityView. This entity aggregates and exposes a structured view of vendor journal entries, likely joining data from underlying tables such as `LedgerJournalTable` and `LedgerJournalTrans`. The 'ByUser' aspect indicates that the entity incorporates logic to filter or associate these journal entries with specific users, potentially based on fields like `CreatedBy`, `ModifiedBy`, or a custom user assignment. This allows external applications to interact with vendor journals in a user-specific context, supporting workflows for user-assigned payment processing, invoice entry, or reconciliation, while leveraging D365's financial posting rules and ensuring data integrity.
