**Purpose:** To enable automated or bulk creation, update, and deletion of documents linked to vendor transactions. This improves data integrity, auditability, and streamlines document management processes by allowing external systems or bulk operations to manage vendor-related documents.

## Overview

This feature facilitates the integration and management of attachments associated with vendor financial transactions within Dynamics 365 Finance & Operations, primarily through a data entity.

- **Object Count:** 1
- **Cohesion Score:** 0.00

## Entry Points

- Data Management Framework (DMF) import/export jobs utilizing the AKAVendTransAttachmentEntity
- OData API calls to the AKAVendTransAttachmentEntity (or similar entity name)
- Custom integration services interacting with the AKAVendTransAttachmentEntity

## Business Logic

The core business logic for this feature is encapsulated within the underlying data entity, likely named AKAVendTransAttachmentEntity. This entity serves as an interface for external systems or bulk operations to interact with attachments related to vendor transactions (e.g., invoices, payments). When data is processed through this entity, the system validates the incoming attachment information, including file content, metadata, and the association with an existing vendor transaction. Upon successful validation, the system creates or updates records in the standard document management tables (DocuRef and DocuValue), linking the attachment to the specified vendor transaction record. This ensures that documents are correctly stored, categorized, and accessible directly from the relevant vendor transaction forms within D365FO. The AKAVendTransAttachmentEntityMaintain security privilege grants the necessary permissions for users or integration accounts to perform these create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) operations on the entity.
