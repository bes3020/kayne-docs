## Business Logic

The AKAProjAdjustmentBatchPostTask class is a core component responsible for executing the posting of project adjustment batches. Its primary business logic involves identifying and retrieving unposted project adjustment batches, then iterating through the individual adjustments contained within each batch. For each adjustment, the class performs necessary validations to ensure data integrity and adherence to business rules. Subsequently, it generates and posts the corresponding financial and project transactions, which typically involves updating project cost and revenue figures, impacting the general ledger, and marking the adjustments as successfully posted. The class also handles error conditions, logs processing details, and updates the status of the batch job, ensuring that a large volume of adjustments can be processed efficiently and reliably in a background process.
