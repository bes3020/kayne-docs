# Vendor Journal Data Import

**Purpose:** To streamline the creation of vendor journal entries by allowing bulk import of data, reducing manual input errors, and providing a structured validation process for incoming financial transactions.

## Overview

This feature manages the import and temporary storage of vendor journal entries, likely uploaded by users, before they are processed and posted within Dynamics 365.

- **Object Count:** 1
- **Cohesion Score:** 0.00

## Entry Points

- Data Management Framework (DMF) for importing data
- Specific DMF entities related to vendor journals (e.g., 'Vendor journal lines')

## Business Logic

The core logic revolves around the AKAVendJournalByUserStaging table acting as an intermediate repository for vendor journal data. External vendor journal data, often provided by users, is first loaded into this staging table. This loading process typically occurs via the Data Management Framework, which handles file parsing and initial data mapping. Once in staging, the data is subject to a series of validations to ensure compliance with D365 business rules, such as checking for valid vendor accounts, ledger accounts, financial dimensions, and transaction types. Records that pass validation are then transferred to the core vendor journal tables (e.g., LedgerJournalTable, LedgerJournalTrans) for creation of actual journal headers and lines. Records failing validation are typically flagged, allowing users to review and correct errors in the staging table or the source file before re-importing. This multi-step process ensures data integrity and provides a robust mechanism for integrating external vendor transaction data.
