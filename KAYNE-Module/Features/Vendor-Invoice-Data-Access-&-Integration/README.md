# Vendor Invoice Data Access & Integration

**Purpose:** To provide a standardized and secure mechanism for external applications, reporting tools, or data migration processes to consume and potentially update vendor invoice information within Dynamics 365 Finance & Operations, ensuring data consistency and security without direct database access.

## Overview

This feature defines and manages access to vendor invoice data through a data entity, primarily for integration with external systems and advanced reporting.

- **Object Count:** 1
- **Cohesion Score:** 0.00

## Entry Points

- Data Management Framework (DMF) for importing/exporting vendor invoice data
- OData endpoints for real-time access to vendor invoice data
- Custom APIs or integrations built on the Vendor Invoice entity

## Business Logic

The `AKAVendInvoiceAllEntityView` privilege grants permissions to an underlying data entity (e.g., `VendInvoiceHeaderEntity`, `VendInvoiceLineEntity`, or a custom combined entity) that exposes comprehensive vendor invoice information. The business logic encapsulated within the *entity itself* involves aggregating data from various source tables (like `VendInvoiceJour`, `VendInvoiceTrans`, `VendTrans`, `VendTable`, etc.) into a simplified, consumable structure. This includes handling relationships, data transformations, and potentially computed fields to present a unified view of vendor invoices. The security privilege ensures that only authorized users or roles can interact with this entity, thereby controlling access to sensitive vendor invoice data for integration, reporting, and data migration scenarios. It does not directly involve the transactional processing (posting, matching) of invoices, but rather the secure exposure of the *results* of that processing.
