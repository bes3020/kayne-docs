# User-Specific Vendor Journal Management

**Purpose:** To improve efficiency and accountability in Accounts Payable by enabling users (e.g., AP clerks, approvers) to easily access, review, and process vendor journals that are relevant to their specific roles or responsibilities, such as journals they created or are assigned to.

## Overview

This feature provides a consolidated view of vendor journals, specifically tailored to show journals associated with individual users. It aims to streamline the management and tracking of Accounts Payable transactions.

- **Object Count:** 1
- **Cohesion Score:** 0.00

## Entry Points

- Custom forms built upon AKAVendJournalByUserView (e.g., 'My Vendor Journals' form)
- Standard vendor journal forms (e.g., VendJournalTable) potentially extended or filtered using this view
- Menu items linking to forms that consume AKAVendJournalByUserView

## Business Logic

The core 'logic' of this feature, as embodied by the AKAVendJournalByUserView, is to aggregate and present vendor journal header and potentially line-level information, filtered or grouped by the user responsible for or associated with the journal. This view likely joins the VendJournalTable with user-related tables (e.g., UserInfo, SysUser) to establish the user context. It facilitates scenarios where an Accounts Payable clerk needs to quickly see all journals they've created, or an approver needs to review journals awaiting their action. While the view itself doesn't execute transactional logic, it provides the data foundation for user interfaces and reports that enable efficient management, review, and processing of vendor journals based on individual user responsibilities within the Accounts Payable workflow.
