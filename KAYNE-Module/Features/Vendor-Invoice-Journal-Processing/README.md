## Business Logic

The LedgerJournalTransVendInvoiceFormAKAEventHandlers class contains event handlers that extend the standard functionality of the vendor invoice journal form. These handlers are designed to implement custom business logic, such as data validation on specific fields (e.g., vendor account, invoice number, amounts), defaulting values, or enforcing specific posting rules. They might also trigger actions or update related data based on user input, ensuring that vendor invoices are correctly prepared and processed before being posted to the general ledger, potentially integrating with other modules like Accounts Payable or Project Accounting to maintain data consistency and enforce business policies.
