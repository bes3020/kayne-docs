- **Object Count:** 1
- **Cohesion Score:** 0.00

## Entry Points

- A dedicated form for 'Ledger Journal Document Review'
- Specific actions or tabs within existing general journal forms (e.g., LedgerJournalTable, LedgerJournalTrans) that allow for document review and status updates.

## Business Logic

The core business logic of this feature revolves around enabling users to associate supporting documents with individual ledger journal lines and manage their review status (e.g., pending, approved, rejected, rework). It likely integrates with a workflow system to route journal lines or entire journals for approval based on predefined criteria such as transaction amount, account type, or user. A critical component is the ability to prevent the posting of general ledger journals until all associated document review processes are complete and approved, ensuring adherence to internal controls. The `AKALedgerJournalTransDocReviewMaintain` privilege specifically grants the necessary permissions to perform these maintenance operations, including updating review statuses, attaching/detaching documents, and adding review-related comments.
