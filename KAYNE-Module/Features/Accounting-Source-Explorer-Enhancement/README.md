## Business Logic

The `DFSAccountingSourceExplorerProcessorAKA_Extension` class is an extension that hooks into the standard `AccountingSourceExplorerProcessor`. Its primary business logic would involve modifying or augmenting the process of retrieving and displaying accounting source information. This could include adding custom fields, applying specific business rules for linking source documents to accounting entries, or enhancing the data presented in the explorer to provide more detailed or specialized insights into financial transactions. The 'AKA' prefix might indicate a specific module or partner-specific customization.
