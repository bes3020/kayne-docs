## Business Logic

The AKALedgerJournalWFApprSubmitToWF class encapsulates the core logic for initiating the workflow approval process for general ledger journals. When triggered, it identifies the selected journal, performs essential pre-submission validations (such as checking for completeness, balance, and adherence to business rules). Following successful validation, the class interacts with the Dynamics 365 Finance & Operations workflow framework to create and start a new workflow instance for the journal. This action typically updates the journal's status to 'Pending approval,' preventing any further modifications or posting until the entire workflow approval process is completed by the designated approvers. This class is a critical component for integrating robust financial controls directly into the journal entry and posting process.
