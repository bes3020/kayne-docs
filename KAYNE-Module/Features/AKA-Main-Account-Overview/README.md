# AKA Main Account Overview

**Purpose:** To offer a tailored and potentially simplified or enhanced perspective on the organization's main accounts, supporting custom financial reporting, analysis, or specific business processes that require a specialized main account dataset.

## Overview

This feature provides a custom, consolidated view of main accounts, likely enriching standard main account data for specific reporting or operational needs.

- **Object Count:** 1
- **Cohesion Score:** 0.00

## Entry Points

- Custom forms or reports that utilize the AKAMainAccountsView, typically accessed via a menu item within the General Ledger module or a custom module.

## Business Logic

The primary business logic is embedded within the AKAMainAccountsView definition itself. This view is designed to consolidate and present specific data points related to main accounts, potentially by joining the standard MainAccount table with other relevant tables (e.g., DimensionAttributeValueCombination, DimensionAttribute, or custom tables) to provide an enriched dataset. This consolidation aims to offer a specialized perspective, possibly including custom attributes, filtered subsets, or aggregated information, to facilitate unique financial reporting, analysis, or data entry requirements not fully met by standard D365FO functionalities. Any further operational logic, such as data manipulation, validations, or workflow, would be implemented in consuming forms, reports, or classes that leverage this view.
