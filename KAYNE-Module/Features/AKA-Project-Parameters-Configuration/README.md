- Project management and accounting parameters (form)

## Business Logic

The core business logic for this feature revolves around defining and storing custom configuration settings within the `ProjParameters` table via the `ProjParameters.AKA` extension. These parameters, once set by an administrator through the 'Project management and accounting parameters' form, are subsequently read by various project-related processes, classes, or forms throughout the system. They dictate specific behaviors, such as enabling/disabling certain functionalities, controlling calculations, influencing validations, or configuring integrations related to the AKA solution within the Project Management and Accounting module. While the specific logic that *consumes* these parameters is not provided, their existence implies that they drive custom business rules and workflows based on the configured values.
