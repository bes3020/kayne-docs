# Financial Dimension Combination Data Management

**Purpose:** To enable accurate financial reporting and analysis by providing a reliable and synchronized source of financial dimension combinations, and to facilitate the integration of this critical data with other business systems.

## Overview

This feature provides a structured view of financial dimension combinations, supported by utilities for data synchronization and an extension for integration purposes, ensuring consistent and accessible dimension data.

- **Object Count:** 3
- **Cohesion Score:** 1.00

## Entry Points

- AKADimensionCombinationView (as a data source for forms, reports, data entities, or APIs)

## Business Logic

The central component is the AKADimensionCombinationView, which serves as a consolidated source for valid financial dimension combinations. This view is essential for ensuring the accuracy of financial transactions and for detailed analytical reporting within Dynamics 365 Finance & Operations. The AKADimensionSchemaAndDataSyncUtilityViews class underpins this by handling the synchronization of dimension schema and data, ensuring that the view always reflects the most current and correct dimension configurations. This utility likely performs tasks such as refreshing dimension data, validating structures, or preparing data for optimal view performance. Furthermore, the AKADimensionCombinationView.DimensionIntegration extension extends the capabilities of the base view, potentially adding specific attributes or logic required for integrating these dimension combinations with external systems, data warehouses, or specialized business intelligence tools, thus broadening the scope and utility of the financial dimension data.
