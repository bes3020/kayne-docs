## Entry Points

- Project management forms (e.g., Project details, Project proposals)

## Business Logic

The core 'logic' of this feature, as represented by the view and its extension, is data aggregation and presentation. The `DFSProjPropFundingSourceView.AKA` view extension is designed to bring together relevant data about project funding sources, potentially including custom fields or specific filtering criteria introduced by the extension. This data would encompass details such as the funding source ID, type, allocated amount, and its association with specific projects or project proposals. The underlying business logic involves the creation and maintenance of funding sources, their allocation to projects, and the financial transactions that consume these funds. The view serves as a critical data layer to support various business processes, including financial analysis, budgeting, and reporting within the project management and finance modules, ensuring that project funding is accurately accounted for and readily visible to stakeholders.
