## Business Logic

The ProjPostCostTrans_AdjNegAKA_Extension class likely contains event handlers or method extensions that intercept the core ProjPostCostTrans logic. Its primary role is to introduce specialized business rules for processing negative project cost adjustments. This could involve custom validations to ensure the legitimacy of negative postings, specific accounting dimension derivations for these adjustments, or unique logic to handle the reversal or offsetting of prior positive cost entries. The 'AdjNegAKA' suffix suggests that these rules are tailored for a particular type of negative adjustment, possibly involving specific conditions or calculations beyond the standard system behavior, ensuring that these unique negative cost scenarios are correctly reflected in project accounting and the general ledger.
