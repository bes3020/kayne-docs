## Business Logic

The `VendTransForm_AKA_Extension` class likely contains event handlers or new methods that augment the behavior of the `VendTransForm`. This could involve custom validation logic when creating or modifying vendor transactions, displaying calculated fields based on existing transaction data, integrating with external systems to fetch or update transaction-related information, or adding custom actions to process selected vendor transactions according to specific business rules. The exact logic would depend on the specific business requirement it addresses, but it operates within the context of displaying and managing individual vendor financial transactions, enhancing the user experience and data integrity.
