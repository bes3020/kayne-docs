## Business Logic

As an event handler class for the 'Daily journals' form (LedgerJournalTransDaily), this feature's business logic primarily involves responding to user interactions and data changes within the daily journal entry process. This typically includes implementing custom validations on journal header (LedgerJournalTable) or line (LedgerJournalTrans) fields to enforce specific business rules beyond standard D365FO checks. It may also involve defaulting values, dynamically enabling or disabling form controls based on selected journal type or user input, and performing additional data updates or calculations before a journal line is saved or a journal is posted. The overall goal is to tailor the daily journal entry experience to specific organizational requirements, ensuring data integrity and process compliance.
