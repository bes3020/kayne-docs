- **Object Count:** 1
- **Cohesion Score:** 0.00

## Entry Points

- Project Adjustment form (typically found under Project management and accounting > Projects > All projects > Manage > Adjust transactions)

## Business Logic

The `ProjAdjustmentFormAKA_Extension` class would contain event handlers and methods that extend the base `ProjAdjustmentForm`. This could involve adding custom fields to the form, implementing validation logic for these new fields, modifying how existing project transactions are selected or processed during an adjustment, or integrating with other modules (e.g., General Ledger, Accounts Payable) for specific adjustment scenarios. The core logic would revolve around ensuring that project adjustments adhere to defined business rules and accurately reflect changes in project financial or operational data, potentially handling specific 'AKA' (an assumed internal acronym or specific type) adjustments.
