## Business Logic

The PSATmpProjProposalTransAKA_Extension class would contain methods that augment the standard processing of temporary project proposal transaction data. This could involve applying specific pricing rules, calculating estimated costs or revenues based on custom logic, populating additional fields for reporting, or performing data validations unique to a specific business requirement. It acts as a hook to inject custom logic into the project proposal generation or display process, ensuring that temporary data accurately reflects the desired business rules before being used for final proposal generation or reporting.
