## Business Logic

The `ProjInvoiceCostAKA_Extension` class would contain custom business logic that hooks into the existing project invoicing framework. This logic could involve overriding or augmenting methods responsible for retrieving, calculating, validating, or posting project costs on an invoice. For instance, it might introduce specific cost allocation rules, apply unique markups or discounts based on cost types, or implement reconciliation logic to compare different cost values (e.g., actual vs. estimated, or different cost categories) before the invoice is finalized. The 'AKA' in the name suggests a focus on specific cost definitions or a comparison/adjustment mechanism, implying a need for specialized cost treatment during the project invoicing lifecycle.
