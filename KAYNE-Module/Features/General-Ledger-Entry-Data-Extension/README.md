**Purpose:** To provide customized or additional financial ledger entry data beyond the standard entity, meeting specific business requirements for financial reporting, analytics, or integration with external systems that require more detailed or specific ledger information.

- **Object Count:** 1
- **Cohesion Score:** 0.00

## Entry Points

- Data Management Framework (for data export/import projects)
- OData services (for real-time data consumption by external applications)
- Custom API integrations (consuming the extended entity)
- Power BI data sources (for financial analytics and reporting)

## Business Logic

The core business logic of the GeneralJournalAccountEntry data entity involves consolidating individual financial ledger entries, including account numbers, financial dimensions, debit/credit amounts, and transaction details, from the underlying GeneralJournalAccountEntry table. This specific extension (`.AKA`) enhances this standard entity by incorporating additional custom fields, derived values, or linking to supplementary data sources. The extension's logic would define how these additional data points are sourced or calculated from the underlying financial tables, allowing for the export or consumption of more comprehensive financial ledger data. This customization enables tailored financial reporting, advanced analytics, or seamless integration with external systems that require specific data elements not present in the standard entity, without modifying the base application code.
