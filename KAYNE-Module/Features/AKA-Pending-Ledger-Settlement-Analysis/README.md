## Business Logic

The core of this feature revolves around the AKALedgerTransSettlementPending table, which serves as a repository for general ledger transactions awaiting a specific settlement process. The AccountingSourceExplorerAKA_Extension class enhances the standard Accounting Source Explorer form, likely by adding new data views, filters, or a dedicated tab that displays the contents of the AKALedgerTransSettlementPending table. This allows users to drill down into individual pending transactions, review their details, and understand their current settlement status. The extension would query and present this data, potentially linking it back to original ledger entries, to provide a comprehensive overview of items that are not yet fully settled, supporting reconciliation and financial process management.
