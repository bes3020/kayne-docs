# Project Funding Rule Data Management Extension

**Purpose:** To enable flexible and customized integration and data migration for project funding rules, allowing businesses to tailor data exchange processes to specific requirements beyond standard entity functionality. This ensures data consistency and adherence to business rules when project funding data is exchanged with external systems or bulk-updated.

## Overview

This feature extends the data management capabilities for project funding rules, primarily facilitating custom logic and data handling during import, export, and OData operations.

- **Object Count:** 1
- **Cohesion Score:** 0.00

## Entry Points

- Data Management Framework (Data entities list, Import/Export projects)
- OData endpoints (for external system integrations)
- Custom APIs or services that consume the ProjFundingRuleEntity

## Business Logic

The ProjFundingRuleEntityAKA_Extension class is designed to enhance the standard ProjFundingRuleEntity. Its business logic would typically involve extending methods related to data mapping, validation, and transformation for project funding rules. This could include adding computed fields, implementing custom data validation rules specific to funding allocations or billing limits, or overriding default data population logic. The class ensures that when project funding rule data is imported, exported, or accessed via OData, any custom business requirements or data integrity checks are applied, thereby maintaining the accuracy and consistency of project financial data across systems.
