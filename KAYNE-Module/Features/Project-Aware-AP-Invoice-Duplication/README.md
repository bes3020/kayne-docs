# Project-Aware AP Invoice Duplication

**Purpose:** To efficiently generate new AP invoices based on existing templates, particularly for recurring project-related expenses or when similar invoices are needed for different periods or project categories, thereby reducing manual data entry and ensuring data consistency.

## Overview

This feature enables the duplication of existing Accounts Payable invoices, allowing for the assignment of a new invoice date and the specification of a project type for the newly created invoice.

- **Object Count:** 2
- **Cohesion Score:** 1.00

## Entry Points

- A custom dialog form or a button on an existing Accounts Payable invoice form (e.g., 'Pending vendor invoices' or 'Vendor invoice journal') that triggers the invoice duplication process.

## Business Logic

The `AKAAPInvoiceCopyNewDateContract` class serves as a data contract, defining the parameters necessary for the AP invoice duplication process. These parameters would typically include the identifier of the source AP invoice, the desired new invoice date, and a selection for the `AKA_ProjectType` enumeration. This `AKA_ProjectType` enum allows users to categorize the new invoice according to its associated project, potentially influencing subsequent processing, accounting dimensions, or approval workflows. The core logic, likely implemented in a separate controller or service class (not provided), would consume this contract, retrieve the details of the source invoice, and then create a new AP invoice record, copying relevant header and line information while applying the specified new date and project type. This mechanism streamlines the creation of similar invoices, especially for project-based accounting scenarios.
