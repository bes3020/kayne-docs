## Business Logic

As an extension class for the LedgerJournalTransDailyForm, this feature likely introduces custom business logic that executes when users interact with the daily ledger journal lines. This could include custom validations to ensure specific data integrity rules are met, automatic defaulting of fields based on other selections or predefined rules, or UI modifications such as adding new controls or changing visibility. It might also involve integration logic, triggering updates or calls to other modules or external systems based on journal line data, or influencing approval workflows related to journal lines. The core focus is on enhancing the user experience and data integrity within the daily journal line entry process beyond standard D365FO functionality.
