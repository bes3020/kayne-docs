# Vendor Transaction Document Management

**Purpose:** To improve financial record-keeping, auditability, and integration by allowing digital documents (e.g., invoices, receipts) to be directly linked to vendor transactions and accessible via data entities.

## Overview

This feature provides capabilities to attach, manage, and integrate supporting documents with vendor ledger transactions within Dynamics 365 Finance & Operations.

- **Object Count:** 1
- **Cohesion Score:** 0.00

## Entry Points

- Data Management Framework (DMF) for import/export of attachment data.
- OData services for programmatic access by external systems.
- Excel Add-in for bulk data operations related to attachments.
- Standard D365FO forms for vendor transactions where attachments can be added/viewed (implicitly leveraging the underlying data structure).

## Business Logic

The core business logic revolves around the association of digital documents with specific vendor ledger transactions (e.g., vendor invoices, payments). This typically involves utilizing Dynamics 365 Finance & Operations' robust document management framework, which handles the storage of document metadata (such as file name, type, and description) and a reference to the actual document content (which might reside in Azure Blob Storage, SharePoint, or the database). The 'AKAVendTransAttachmentEntityView' privilege specifically grants access to a data entity or view that exposes this attachment information for vendor transactions. This enables integration scenarios where external systems can query, create, or update these attachments programmatically, ensuring that all supporting documentation is consistently linked to financial records and accessible for auditing and reporting purposes.
