## Business Logic

The AKAVendInvoiceAllEntity aggregates and denormalizes data from various underlying tables related to vendor invoices, such as invoice headers, lines, vendor details, and financial dimensions. While the entity itself doesn't contain transactional business logic like posting or approval, it provides a structured and simplified view of the complex vendor invoice data model. This allows external systems to easily consume or provide comprehensive vendor invoice information, including status, amounts, dates, and associated vendor details, without needing to understand the intricate table relationships of the core application. The underlying business logic for invoice processing (matching, posting, workflow) resides in the tables and classes that this entity exposes data from.
