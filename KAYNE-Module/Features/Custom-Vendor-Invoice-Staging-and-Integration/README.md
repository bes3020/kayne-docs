# Custom Vendor Invoice Staging and Integration

**Purpose:** To provide a robust mechanism for importing, validating, and preparing vendor invoice data from various sources, ensuring data quality and efficient integration into the core D365FO vendor invoice processing workflow. This reduces manual data entry and streamlines invoice processing for external or high-volume scenarios.

## Overview

This feature manages the temporary storage and initial processing of vendor invoices, likely originating from external systems or bulk imports, before they are posted in Dynamics 365 Finance & Operations.

- **Object Count:** 1
- **Cohesion Score:** 0.00

## Entry Points

- A custom form (e.g., 'AKAVendInvoiceAllStagingForm') to view and manage staged invoices
- A custom menu item to access the staging form
- Data Management Framework (DMF) import projects for bulk data loading
- Potentially custom integration services or APIs for automated data feeds

## Business Logic

The core business logic centers around the `AKAVendInvoiceAllStaging` table, which serves as a temporary holding area for vendor invoice data. Data is typically loaded into this table from external sources via import processes (e.g., DMF, custom integrations). Once in staging, the data undergoes a series of validations to ensure compliance with D365FO business rules, such as verifying vendor existence, correct financial dimensions, item numbers, and accurate amounts. Users or automated routines can review and correct any discrepancies within the staging environment, often through a dedicated user interface. After successful validation, the staged data is then processed to create and potentially post actual vendor invoice records in the D365FO `VendInvoiceJour` and `VendInvoiceTrans` tables. This process usually includes comprehensive error logging, status tracking, and mechanisms to handle failed postings, ensuring data integrity and a clear audit trail. The 'All' in the table name suggests it might handle a comprehensive set of invoice data or different invoice types.
