## Business Logic

The `LedgerJournalTransAKA_Extension` class contains custom business logic that executes in response to events on `LedgerJournalTrans` records. This typically involves event handlers or method extensions that intercept operations like `insert`, `update`, `validate`, or `post` for journal lines. The logic likely includes custom validations to enforce specific data integrity rules, defaulting of financial dimensions or other fields based on complex criteria, or additional processing steps required for the 'AKA' business process. This ensures that all journal lines created or modified adhere to the organization's specific requirements beyond the standard D365 F&O capabilities.
