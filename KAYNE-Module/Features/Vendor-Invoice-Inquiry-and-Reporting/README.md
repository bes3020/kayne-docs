## Business Logic

While the AKAVendInvoiceAllView itself is a data aggregation layer and does not contain executable business logic, it is a crucial component of the broader vendor invoice management process. The underlying business logic, which this view exposes, includes the creation and posting of vendor invoices, matching invoices to purchase orders and product receipts, tracking payment status, and potentially incorporating approval workflows. The view's 'logic' is in its definition: joining relevant tables (such as VendInvoiceInfoTable, VendInvoiceTrans, VendTable, PurchTable, and LedgerJournalTrans for payments) and potentially applying filters or calculated fields to present a holistic view of each vendor invoice, its lines, associated vendor, and payment status. This consolidated data is then used by forms and reports to provide insights into the financial obligations and payment history related to vendors.
