# Vendor Alternate Name Management

**Purpose:** To enhance vendor identification and search capabilities by allowing businesses to store multiple names for a single vendor. This helps in accurately identifying vendors known by different trade names, former names, or names in various languages, thereby improving data accuracy and operational efficiency.

## Overview

This feature enables the recording and management of 'Also Known As' (AKA) names for vendor records, extending the core vendor master data functionality.

- **Object Count:** 1
- **Cohesion Score:** 0.00

## Entry Points

- Vendor details form (VendTable form)
- Potentially a dedicated menu item or tab within the Vendor details for managing AKA names

## Business Logic

The `VendTableAKA_Extension` class is designed to extend the standard `VendTable` functionality to support alternate vendor names. This typically involves adding new fields or integrating a related data source (e.g., a custom `VendTableAKA` table) to the `VendTable` form. The business logic within this extension would likely include methods for creating, updating, and deleting these alternate names, ensuring they are correctly linked to the primary vendor record. It may also incorporate validation rules to maintain data integrity, such as preventing duplicate AKA names or enforcing specific naming conventions. Furthermore, this extension could provide logic to enable searching for vendors using their alternate names, significantly improving the lookup process and overall vendor data management.
