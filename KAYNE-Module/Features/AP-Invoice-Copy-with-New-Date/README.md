# AP Invoice Copy with New Date

**Purpose:** To efficiently generate new AP invoices based on existing templates, particularly when only the date needs to be adjusted, thereby reducing manual data entry and ensuring consistency for recurring or similar transactions.

## Entry Points

- Menu item (Action button) on an Accounts Payable invoice form or list page
- Dialog form for new date input (invoked by the controller)

## Business Logic

The AKAAPInvoiceCopyNewDateController class orchestrates the process of duplicating an Accounts Payable invoice. It typically takes an existing invoice as a source, presents a user interface (likely a dialog) to prompt for a new date (e.g., document date, invoice date, or posting date) for the new invoice. Upon user confirmation, it copies the relevant data from the original invoice's header and lines, applies the specified new date to the appropriate fields of the newly created invoice, and then persists this new invoice into the system. This process likely includes validation of the new date and ensures that all necessary related information (such as financial dimensions, tax details, and vendor information) is correctly transferred or re-evaluated for the new transaction.
