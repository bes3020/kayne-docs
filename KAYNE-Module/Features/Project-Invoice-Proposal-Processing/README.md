## Business Logic

The core business logic revolves around the management of project invoice proposals. Users can generate proposals based on project transactions (hours, expenses, items), review and adjust proposed invoice lines, apply funding rules or retention, and prepare the proposal for final posting. The 'ProjInvoiceProposalDetailFormAKA_Extension' class specifically extends the functionality of the 'ProjInvoiceProposalDetailForm'. This extension likely introduces custom validations, calculations, or UI modifications tailored to specific business requirements, potentially related to alternative billing scenarios, specific project types, or additional data capture. It integrates with the standard project invoicing process, ensuring that any custom logic is applied during the detailed review and preparation of project invoices before they are finalized and posted to the general ledger and accounts receivable.
