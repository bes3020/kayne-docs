## Business Logic

The `LedgerTransListReportHelperAKA_Extension` class modifies the behavior of the `LedgerTransListReportHelper` class, which is responsible for preparing data for the Ledger Transaction List Report. This extension likely introduces custom logic to retrieve, process, or filter ledger transaction data, potentially adding new columns, applying specific business rules for data inclusion, or altering how existing data is presented in the report. The specific modifications would be defined within the extension methods, overriding or augmenting the standard report's data generation process to meet specific business reporting needs.
