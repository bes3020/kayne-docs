- **Object Count:** 1
- **Cohesion Score:** 0.00

## Entry Points

- Menu items related to Project proposals (e.g., 'Project proposals', 'Project quotes')
- Forms for managing project proposal details and lines (e.g., 'ProjProposal' form, 'ProjQuotationTable' form)
- Actions within project proposal forms, such as 'Calculate costs' or 'Confirm proposal'

## Business Logic

The ProjProposalCostAKA_Extension class likely contains business logic that customizes or enhances the standard cost calculation and management processes for project proposals. This could involve implementing specific costing methodologies, applying unique overheads or markups, integrating with custom project accounting rules for cost recognition, or modifying how different cost types (labor, expenses, items) are estimated and tracked within a proposal. It would typically extend existing methods on forms or tables to ensure that proposal costs are accurately reflected and managed according to specific business requirements, influencing the overall financial viability and pricing of projects.
