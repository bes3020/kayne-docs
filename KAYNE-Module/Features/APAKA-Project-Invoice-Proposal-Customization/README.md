## Business Logic

The `ProjInvoiceProposalGenAPAKA_Extension` class modifies the standard logic of the `ProjInvoiceProposalGen` class, which is responsible for creating project invoice proposals. As an extension, it likely uses event handlers or method extensions to inject custom code at various stages of the proposal generation process. This custom logic could involve altering the selection criteria for project transactions (e.g., hours, expenses, items), applying specific pricing or discount rules, populating additional custom fields on the invoice proposal header or lines, performing unique validations, or integrating with APAKA-specific data structures. The core objective is to tailor the out-of-the-box project invoice proposal functionality to meet the distinct business processes and data requirements defined by the APAKA customization.
