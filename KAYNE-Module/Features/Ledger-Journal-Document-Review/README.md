- **Object Count:** 1
- **Cohesion Score:** 0.00

## Entry Points

- A dedicated 'Ledger Journal Document Review' form or inquiry.
- Integrated functionality within existing journal forms (e.g., LedgerJournalTable, LedgerJournalTrans) to access document links or status.
- Menu items leading to these document review forms or inquiries.

## Business Logic

The core business logic revolves around the ability to link external documents (such as invoices, receipts, or approval forms) to specific lines within general ledger journals (LedgerJournalTrans records). This involves mechanisms for document attachment, storage (potentially leveraging Dynamics 365 document management features like SharePoint integration), and maintaining references within the system. The AKALedgerJournalTransDocReviewView privilege specifically grants users the permission to view these journal lines along with their associated documents. This implies a user interface (likely a form) where users can browse journal entries and easily access or preview the linked supporting documentation. While this privilege focuses on viewing, the broader feature would likely encompass processes for attaching documents, potentially tracking their review status, and ensuring that financial entries are adequately supported for audit and compliance purposes.
