## Business Logic

The `ProjInvoiceJournalFormAKA_Extension` class likely introduces custom business logic directly on the `ProjInvoiceJournal` form. This could involve adding new data fields, implementing custom validation rules for project invoice data, modifying the display or behavior of existing controls, or integrating new actions related to project invoices. The extension aims to tailor the project invoice journal process to specific organizational needs, potentially by automating certain steps, providing additional insights, or enforcing unique business policies during invoice review and posting.
