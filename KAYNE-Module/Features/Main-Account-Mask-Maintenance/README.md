## Entry Points

- General Ledger > Chart of accounts > Structures of accounts > Configure account structures (Form)
- Main account masks (potentially a dedicated form or a section within the 'Configure account structures' form)

## Business Logic

The core business logic of this feature revolves around the creation, modification, and deletion of main account masks. Users define patterns (e.g., '????', '100*', '2000..2999') using wildcards and ranges to represent specific sets or ranges of main accounts. These masks are then integrated into account structure rules, which dictate valid financial dimension combinations for particular main accounts. When financial transactions are processed, the system utilizes these configured account structures and their associated main account masks to validate the entered main account and financial dimension values. This validation ensures that only predefined and permissible combinations are accepted, preventing data entry errors and maintaining the integrity and consistency of financial postings. The `AKAMainAccountMaskMaintain` privilege grants the necessary security permissions to perform these maintenance operations on main account masks.
